LearnChess is a open source project made to help people get better at chess.

## Features

### [Puzzles](https://learnchess.tk/puzzles)

You can submit puzzles and get a rating by solving. All puzzles are made by people and reviewed by people. This helps make them more natural and educational. [Chessvariants](https://chessvariants.training) is similar except it is for chess variants only.

### [Coordinates trainer](https://learnchess.tk/coordinates)

[Lichess](https://lichess.org/training/coordinate) and [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/vision) have it, so LearnChess needs it too. You can optionally display your latest score on your profile.

### [Play with the computer](https://learnchess.tk/computer)

Can you beat Stockfish? Probably not, but it is a weakened version of it, so give it a try. Features like takebacks and different levels are coming soon.
